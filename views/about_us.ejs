    Eschatophage is a blackened thrash metal band hailing from Antwerp, Belgium, founded in 2021 by bassist and vocalist Exan. Drawing influence from iconic thrash and blackened metal acts such as Butcher, Hellripper, and Exodus, the band seeks to carve their own path in the aggressive and fast-paced world of extreme metal.
    The band's journey began when Exan, passionate about thrash metal’s intensity, set out to form a lineup that could realize his creative vision. However, the search for committed members proved challenging. For two years, Exan experimented with different musicians while continuing to refine his musical ideas. In 2023, the search led him to guitarist Stef, whose riffing style perfectly matched Eschatophage's savage sound.
    In 2024, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place with the addition of drummer Dante, whose relentless drumming style provided the solid backbone the band needed. Around this time, Exan also stepped up as the band’s vocalist, taking on the additional role of frontman to ensure his artistic vision was fully realized. This complete lineup solidified Eschatophage's sound, blending blistering thrash riffs, eerie black metal atmospheres, and ferocious energy.
    Now with the right lineup in place, Eschatophage has begun working on their first demo, a release that promises to encapsulate their fierce, no-compromise approach to blackened thrash. The band is also preparing for their first live performances, eager to bring their unrelenting sound to stages across Belgium and beyond.
    Despite being a relatively new act, Eschatophage’s dedication to their craft and their love for the old-school metal ethos have set them apart. Their future looks bright as they prepare to unleash their music on the underground metal scene, embodying the DIY spirit of metal bands who thrive on raw energy and uncompromising aggression.
