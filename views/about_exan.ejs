<p>Exan began his bass journey in 2016 after discovering a passion for old-school metal and rock. He was captivated by the raw energy, intricate riffs, and powerful presence that bassists brought to the genre, which inspired him to pick up the instrument. Initially drawn to the heavy, groove-laden sounds of classic rock and metal bands, Exan’s musical preferences soon evolved into more aggressive and technical styles, leading him toward thrash, death, and progressive metal.
Over time, Exan immersed himself in these subgenres, finding inspiration in legendary bass players whose distinct playing styles and approaches to bass shaped his technique and sound. Key influences include Cliff Burton of Metallica, renowned for his virtuosic use of distortion, wah pedals, and groundbreaking solos; Alex Webster of Cannibal Corpse and Blotted Science, whose technical precision and speed redefined the role of bass in death metal; and John Myung of Dream Theater, a master of intricate, progressive compositions.
In addition, Exan draws from the foundational grooves of Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath, whose doom-laden, blues-infused basslines helped define the sound of heavy metal, and Rex Brown of Pantera, whose tight, punchy bass work created a perfect rhythm foundation for one of the most influential groove metal bands.
Bands like Exodus, Hellripper, and Lamb of God have also shaped Exan's approach, inspiring him with their relentless aggression, thrash-driven energy, and uncompromising intensity. This blend of influences allowed Exan to forge his unique style, characterized by a mix of technical prowess, groove, and raw aggression, making his bass work an integral part of eschatophage. Whether channeling the lightning-fast precision of thrash, the deep, guttural rhythms of death metal, or the complex time signatures of progressive metal, Exan’s playing continues to evolve, driven by his passion for the genre and the legends who came before him.</p>
